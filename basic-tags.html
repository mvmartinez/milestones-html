    <h1>The Impact of Shrek 2</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Why Shrek 2 is the Best movie</h2>
      <p>It is <b>The Best</b> animated film in the <i>history</i> of film. No one remembers a single plot point from any of the other shrek movies, but everyone references Shrek 2. Not to mention the Fairy Godmother's rendition of Bonnie Tyler's "Holding Out for A Hero," had done more for Gay Rights than any legislation passed in America in recent history. No animation since of before has had the cultural and social impact of Shrek 2.</p>

      <h2>Reasons to watch Shrek 2</h2>
      <h3>According to me</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>It has gay representation</h4>
          <p>It was the first animated gay representation we saw in the history of cinema! Where you ask? In the ending sequence when Ricky Martin sings, we didn't know it was representation at the time but now it is.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>It has a great message</h4>
          <p>The message in question? Being ugly is ok.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>The- and I cannot stress this enough- Fairy Godmother</h4>
